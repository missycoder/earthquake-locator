# Earthquake Locator

This is a simple web application that uses [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/), [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), and [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) to display recent earthquakes on an interactive map. It also uses [Leaflet.markercluster](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.markercluster) for clustering markers.
